                    <p>A virus is a type of malware that is designed to replicate itself and spread to other computers. It typically attaches itself to a legitimate program or file, and when that program or file is executed, the virus also runs and infects the computer. (Crowdstrike, 2021)</p>

                <details>
                    <summary>Ransomware</summary>
                    <p>Ransomware is malware that encrypts files on an infected computer and demands a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key.</p>
                    <p>Once the files have been encrypted, the victim is typically unable to access their data until the ransom is paid. (Zhang, 2020)</p>
                    <p>Ransomware is typically spread through email attachments, malicious websites, or infected software downloads.</p>
